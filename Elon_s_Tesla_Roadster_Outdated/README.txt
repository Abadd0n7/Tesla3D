# Summary

<h2> Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster</h2>

This is the first and best free model of a Tesla Roadster available. Modeled specifically after the one currently floating freely through space. You know, the one that one guy with the funny name owned and decided to strap onboard an untested rocket that could have exploded at any moment. How dangerous...


Complete with the convertible look, Midnight Cherry paint job and 'Don't Panic' sign.


Future Plans:
-Starman
-Hot Wheels Tesla Roadster on the dash
-To convert to a functioning car so all of us cheapos can say we have a Tesla. I'll add supercharging, don't worry.


Note: You can try to 3D Print this if you would like, but I highly doubt it is compatible in its current form. This was more just a 3D model showcase and way to obtain a good Tesla Roadster model for free. That was the entire intent of this project.
